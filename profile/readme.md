- **FifthXenia is a creative sangha** developing modular and distributed solutions that benefit and support humanity, bolster resiliency, and deepen our **direct** relationship with the world and with each other, evolving our earthly ecosystem to that of a higher order and resonance, through the means of viscerally enspiriting, the individual, disembodied, panjandrum. üèá
  - **We are propagators for the triratna of axioms that:**
    - 1: `The love that sustains within the worst of creation, is the birthplace of creation. The primordial you.`
    - 2: `The impersonal, is more personal, and more primordial, than the immediately personal, and any labels.`
    - 3: `Wholesome zeal propagates through curious, anewing play. Not through: more of the same, regurgitation.`
  - **There are three aspects of reality: The manifested world, natural law, and the flesh. All three should serve the spirit (liberty, truth).**
    - 1: `The Manifested World [a creation, a result]`
      - (The world is a manifestation of humanities aggregated sovereignty of its flesh, and our understanding of natural law. The less moral, the less knowledgable, the less courageous, the more slavery, and coercion, is to be the law of the land.)
    - 2: `Natural Law [a limit, a truth]`
      - (Evil must not engulf the world, as there are the higher natural laws of morality, of self-defense, etc, that take precendence. All is not relative. All evil will not be accepted, in totality.)
    - 3: `The Flesh [a sovereign]`
      - (The flesh, if not abiding by natural law, enters a deep imbalance, of pure selfishness, immorality, relativity, and evilness. However, because of free will, one can live as the flesh, without living by it's dictates. Living in the flesh, but not being of it. Living in the world, but not being of it.  Seeking truth, propagating liberty, morality.)
